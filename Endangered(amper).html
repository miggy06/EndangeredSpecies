    <div class="content">
        <p>The Department of Environment and Natural Resources issued an administrative order in 2007 that produced a nationwide list of threatened plant species, showing that 99 species are critically endangered, 187 endangered, 176 vulnerable, and 64 threatened.</p>

            <p>Also called the monkey-eating eagle, the <span class="highlight">Philippine eagle</span> is native to the southern Philippines. It is characterized by a brown and white feather pattern and bushy crest and is believed to be one of the largest
                and most powerful birds on Earth.A full-grown adult can grow to as big as four feet (ft) tall and can weigh as much as nine kilograms (kg).</p>

            <p>Also known as the <span class="highlight">Mindoro dwarf buffalo</span>, the <span class="highlight">Tamaraw</span> is the only known bovine indigenous to the Philippines. Until the 20th century, the original habitat of this species was essentially
                intact and unharmed. They were once found all over Mindoro Island, from the plains up to the mountains. But now the population has been reduced to about 200, with many being carefully bred in captivity.</p>
